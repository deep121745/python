hierarchy of operators:
PEMDAS
In python , // is used to round off 
            ** is used to calculate power 

Variables-> it is a placeholder for some value
 variablename = value

String -> basically means text , and should be included between quotes
a="hey "
to print stuff -> 
print("___")

to printout raw string i.e, without considering escape characters,etc include r :
print(r"___")

we can also add as well as multiply strings together in python

Accessing characters in strings:
a[0,1,2,...]    OR   a[-1,-2,-3,....]

Slicing characters:
         a[start:end-1]
         a[:]   gives entire string

len(a)  ->   gives length of our string

making LIST->  

listname =[1,2,3,...]
we can change its entry as: listname[2]=new value      (we can also replace multiple items using _:_)
we can also delete items by setting it equal to empty []
we can add new entries to our list as: listname + [6,3,5,6]
but this process is temporary so in order to do it permanently:
listname.append(one argument)
We can also slice our lists

**Identation is very important in python 
1. if condition:
        print("__")

2.if condition is ___:                     {when dealing with numbers use is while with    
      print("___")
  elif condition is __:                       numbers use relational operators}
       print("__") 
If none of them is true then use
   else:
       print("__")

for variable in listname:
     print(variable)


**RANGE: loop without list
for variable in range(5);
     print("__")

we can also give range of numbers :
  range(begin,end,how much increment)

**while loop run until condition become false
while condition :
    print(variable)

to stop loop we use increment conditions so that after some execution condition gets false .

Comments: #........(single line)
          ***..........
             ............***


whenever we want to print no. with string then use comma:
print("hi",5)

break -> stops loop and break execution

continue ->  ignores certain items and continue execution

Functions: set of codes which are written for our comfort as we don't 've to over n over again
Defining function: 
    def functionname ():                  
         line of code                         
         __________
         print('___')

To use this function:
 functionname()

 inside paranthesis we provide extra info declaring variable,etc
 def sum(a):
     ans=a+3
      print(ans)
On calling:
sum(2)        it gives 5

Return-> it is use to use our calculated value further
def sum(a):
     ans=a+3
      return ans
d=sum(2)
def mult(c)
      pro=c*d
after calling:
 mult(5)

Setting default value:
def gender(sex='unknown'):
    if sex is 'm':
         sex='male'
    elif sex is 'f':
         sex='female'
    print(sex)

 gender('m')   -> gives male
 gender('f')   -> gives female
 gender()   -> gives default i.e, unknown
